Certainly! Here's a comprehensive prompt you can use to ask an AI (like ChatGPT or another code generation tool) to generate a complete codebase for your HomeInspector AI app:

Prompt:

"Please generate a complete, working example of a HomeInspector AI application that accepts user-uploaded videos and detects house defects such as mold, cracks, water leaks, and paint problems. The application should include the following components:

Backend API:

Accepts video uploads via HTTP POST.
Processes videos by extracting frames.
Runs defect detection using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLOv5 or similar).
Returns annotated images/video or JSON with detected defects, locations, and confidence scores.

Model:

Use transfer learning with a pre-trained object detection model fine-tuned on relevant defect datasets.
Include code for loading the model, running inference on frames, and aggregating results.

Frontend Interface:

Simple web page allowing users to upload videos.
Displays processed results with bounding boxes and labels overlaid on key frames or videos.

Additional features:

Basic error handling.
Clear comments explaining each part of the code.

Use Python for backend (FastAPI or Flask), HTML/JavaScript for frontend, OpenCV for video processing, and PyTorch/TensorFlow for the model. Provide instructions on how to set up dependencies and run the app locally."
